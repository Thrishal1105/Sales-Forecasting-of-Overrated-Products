# 📊 Sales Forecasting of Overrated Products

### Using NLP, Sentiment-Enhanced Ratings & Ensemble Forecasting

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In e-commerce platforms, product ratings play a critical role in influencing customer decisions and sales forecasting. However, **numerical ratings often fail to reflect true customer satisfaction**, as users may give high ratings while expressing dissatisfaction in their review text.

This project addresses the **rating–review mismatch problem** by integrating **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **time-series forecasting models** to detect and correct **overrated products**. The system generates **sentiment-tuned ratings** that better represent actual customer feedback and improves the reliability of sales forecasting.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Customers frequently provide high numerical ratings (e.g., 5⭐) while mentioning negative aspects in their review text (e.g., battery failure, poor quality).
This mismatch leads to:

* Overrated products
* Misleading demand estimation
* Poor inventory and business decisions

Traditional forecasting models rely only on historical ratings and sales data, ignoring the semantic meaning of customer reviews.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect mismatch between customer ratings and review sentiment
* Reduce rating bias using NLP-based sentiment analysis
* Identify overrated products early
* Improve sales forecasting accuracy
* Provide explainable, data-driven insights for manufacturers and platforms

---

## 🧠 Proposed Solution

The proposed system uses a **two-layer architecture**:

### 🔹 1. Review-Level NLP Correction

* Customer review text is analyzed using **sentiment analysis**
* Sentiment is converted into a numeric score
* A **sentiment-tuned rating** is generated by combining:

  * User-given rating
  * Sentiment-derived rating

### 🔹 2. Forecast-Level Stabilization

* Historical sentiment-tuned ratings are used to train forecasting models:

  * Prophet
  * SARIMAX
  * XGBoost
* An **ensemble model** combines predictions to ensure stability and robustness

The final rating reflects both **individual customer feedback** and **historical trends**.

## 🗂️ Dataset

* **Amazon All Beauty Reviews Dataset**
* ~7 lakh customer reviews
* Fields used:

  * Rating
  * Review title
  * Review text
  * Timestamp
  * Product identifier (ASIN)

Data preprocessing includes:

* Duplicate removal
* Text cleaning
* Timestamp conversion
* Monthly aggregation

## 📊 Model Evaluation

Forecasting models were evaluated using **error metrics**:

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**

### 🔹 Results Summary

| Model    | MAE       | RMSE      |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Prophet  | 0.131     | 0.171     |
| SARIMAX  | **0.117** | **0.159** |
| XGBoost  | 0.191     | 0.244     |
| Ensemble | 0.145     | 0.187     |

**Observation:**

* SARIMAX achieved the lowest error
* Ensemble model provided robustness and stability
* XGBoost struggled with limited monthly time-series data
