# 📊 Sales Forecasting of Overrated Products

### NLP-Driven Rating Correction & Advanced Forecasting Analytics

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

In modern e-commerce platforms, numerical ratings are widely used to measure customer satisfaction and forecast demand. However, many customers give **high star ratings while expressing dissatisfaction in review text**, resulting in **overrated products** and **misleading sales forecasts**.

This project solves that problem by integrating **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **sentiment-enhanced rating correction**, and **advanced forecasting models** into a unified, analytics-driven system.
The solution is delivered through an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** designed for business decision-makers.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

A common real-world issue in e-commerce platforms:

> ⭐ Rating: *5/5*
> 📝 Review: *“Good product, but the battery stopped working after two days.”*

This mismatch causes:

* Overrated products
* Inflated demand forecasts
* Inventory misallocation
* Poor product and vendor decisions

Traditional forecasting models rely only on **historical ratings**, ignoring the **semantic meaning of customer feedback**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Detect **rating–sentiment mismatches** in customer reviews
* Identify **overrated products** that pose business risk
* Improve **sales & demand forecasting accuracy**
* Provide **explainable analytics dashboards** for stakeholders
* Demonstrate **model comparison & justification** for academic evaluation

---

## 🧠 Proposed Solution Architecture

The system is designed as a **multi-layer pipeline**:

---

### 🔹 Layer 1: NLP-Based Rating Correction (Micro Level)

* Review text is processed using **VADER Sentiment Analysis**
* A **sentiment score** (–1 to +1) is extracted
* A **sentiment-adjusted rating** is computed using:

  * User-given rating
  * Sentiment-derived rating scale

📌 Output: **Corrected rating per review**

---

### 🔹 Layer 2: Forecasting & Stability Modeling (Macro Level)

Sentiment-corrected ratings are aggregated monthly and used for forecasting.

Models implemented:

* Prophet
* SARIMAX
* XGBoost

Purpose:

* Capture seasonality
* Reduce noise from biased ratings
* Provide baseline forecasting comparison

---

### 🔹 Layer 3: Advanced Machine Learning (Final Model)

To improve **accuracy and stability**, additional models were evaluated:

* **Bagged LightGBM (Best Performing Model)**
* CatBoost

Bagging improves:

* Variance reduction
* Stability on noisy review data
* Generalization across categories

📌 **Bagged LightGBM is used as the final production model**

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

* **Amazon All Beauty Reviews Dataset**
* ~700,000 customer reviews
* Time span: Multiple years

### Key Fields Used

* Review text
* Original rating
* Timestamp
* Product ID (ASIN)
* Category

### Preprocessing Steps

* Duplicate removal
* Text cleaning
* Sentiment extraction
* Rating correction
* Monthly aggregation
* Risk classification

Final processed dataset:

```
data/processed_reviews.parquet
```

## 📊 Model Evaluation & Comparison

All models were evaluated using:

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**

### 🔹 Accuracy Comparison

| Model               | MAE ↓      | RMSE ↓     |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Prophet             | 0.131      | 0.171      |
| SARIMAX             | 0.117      | 0.159      |
| XGBoost             | 0.191      | 0.244      |
| CatBoost            | 0.0015     | 0.0043     |
| **Bagged LightGBM** | **0.0003** | **0.0026** |
| 5-Model Ensemble    | 0.115      | 0.153      |

🏆 **Conclusion:**
Bagged LightGBM provides the **best accuracy, stability, and robustness** and is therefore selected as the final prediction model.
